\subsection{Introduction}

The main idea of this project is to develop a waveform generator instrument using an STM32
micro controller and its built in DAC. The project has 2 parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Software}: The application needs to showcase the STM32 capability of output
          waveforms  at sample rates of 100kHz or greater. The software need to include a
          peripheral driver to access the built in DAC using DMA;
    \item \textbf{Hardware}: The device has to to implement a waveform generator output stage
          circuitry that allows to extend the capabilities of the built in DAC.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design of the Printed Circuit Board}

The goal I set out to achieve is a stand-alone PCB with builtin micro controller
